Why R?
========================================================
  1. R is free
    
  2. It can compute most higher mathematical
  computations and statistics
    
  3. Great visualization tool for data
  
  4. Can do GIS mapping, given coordinates
  
  5. Can perform cloud computing with R, as well as gain access to a variety of repositories
  
  6. Can gain access to repositories, and download  and query structured data

**Most likely, it will meet your needs as a scientist.**




R projects, rRmarkdown, and good housekeeping
========================================================
Projects eliminates the need for you to manually code in dependencies across files, allowing for easier sharing of code while removing dependency breaks.

R markdown files allow you to use html markdown and other coding aspects such as latex along with R code, so that you can build a functioning report while executing code.

**Unless you're writting your own functions and/or scripts, generally code using rmkd files and save them to a project.**


R coding basics
========================================================

At this point let's build a project, rmkd file, in R.

Then, we will go over some basic operators and concepts in R: vectorization, data types, and packages.
