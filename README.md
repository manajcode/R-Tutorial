# R Tutorial
Here I've created my own tutorial on how to use R. I presented this material to the Oikawa lab at CSU East Bay as part of a training workshop to program in R. 

As a member of An Earth Science Laboratory, I catered the workshop towards Earth Scientist, focusing on data manipulation and visualization of time series data.

The data I used in this workshop came from Earth Lab's Intro to R & Work with Time Series Data program Week 2. The data can be downloaded from: https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/earth-analytics/time-series-data/

The contents of this repository are as follows:

1. earthanalyticswk2: Data from Earth Lab

2. MNajarro_R_workshop_Presentation.html: The actual slideshow presentation I presented at the start of the workshop

3. MNajarro_R_workshop_Presentation.md: A required file to run the slideshow.

4. MNajarro_R_workshop_Presentation.rpres: The introductory slideshow presentation file I created in R.

5. MNajarro_Rworkshop_code.Rmd: the R-markdown file that contains the tutorial/training code.

6. R_workshop.Rproj: the main R project file- open first if you wish to edit any R code.
